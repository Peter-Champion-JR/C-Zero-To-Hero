## Day 1
### Introduction to the basics of programming in C# while creating a simple console application

### Learning Objectives
- Install Visual Studio/.NET SDK
- Create your first console app: `dotnet new console`
- Understand structure of a C# project
- Checkpoint: Print a greeting with user input

### Key Concepts
- **C#**: A modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft.
- **.NET SDK**: A software development kit that includes tools and libraries for building applications using .NET.
- **Console Application**: A simple program that runs in a command-line interface, allowing interaction through text input and output.
- **Project Structure**: A C# project typically includes files like `Program.cs`, `*.csproj`, and a `bin` directory for compiled output.
- **User Input**: Capturing data from the user via the console, often using `Console.ReadLine()`.
- **Output**: Displaying information to the user using `Console.WriteLine()`.
- **Variables**: Named storage locations in memory that hold data, defined with a type (e.g., `int`, `string`).
- **Data Types**: Categories of data that determine what kind of values a variable can hold (e.g., `int` for integers, `string` for text).

### Reflection
Overall this day introductioes you the foundational concepts of programming in C# and how to setup a development enviroment. 
you end up learning how to create a simple console application that takes user imput and prints a greeting message from user imput.
